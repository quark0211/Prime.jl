# Prime.jl

**Prime.jl** is a Julia package that implements a **cell clustering method based on a biophysical gene-expression model**, formulated under the **Probability Generating Function (PGF)** framework.

The package provides a concise public interface with two main entry-point functions:

- **`prime_cluster`**: performs **cell clustering** under the PGF-based modeling framework.
- **`prime_infer_to_csv`**: performs **Bayesian inference** of **gene- and cluster-specific model parameters**, and **exports the inferred parameters to CSV** for downstream analysis and quality control.

A complete, runnable usage example is provided here:
